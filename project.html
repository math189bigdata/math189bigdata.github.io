						<h2>Final Project</h2>
						<br>
						<h3>Description:</h3>
						<p>
							This is by far the largest component of the course.
							You will discover, explore, and attack a real world
							problem of your choosing.
							There are <b> three </b> types of projects you
							can work on, shown below in order of increasing difficulty:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								(1) Application of existing algorithm to a new problem and
								potentially new data.
							</li>
							<li>
								(2) Mathematics foundation or Algorithm work. You can choose to a) develop mathematical foundation for an existing machine learning algorithm, or b) provide interpretation for a deep learning algorithm in accordance with explainable machine learning, or c) extend an existing algorithm
	              or conceive a new one to solve some problem (This inherently includes the first option because you will
	              need to test this new algorithm on data).
							</li>

							<li>
								(3) Theoretical work. Create a new convergence bound
	              on a learning algorithm. Show that at some limit
	              one learning algorithm becomes another. Etc.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							These also have increasing risk. For example, you cannot
	            turn in a paper saying you worked on a convergence bound
	            for months with no results. Option two has medium risk because
	            part of the process of creating a new algorithm is creating
	            baselines to improve upon.
	            At <i>any</i> time during the course <i>please</i> feel free
	            to come and discuss your problem and ask questions with the
	            instructor or TA.

					</p>

					<h3>Requirements:</h3>
						All of the requirements below must be satisfied in order
						to receive full credits for the project:

					<ul>
						<br>
						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Partner:</i></b> <br>
							Maximum of 1 partner (we may concede to 2 partners
              in extreme scenarios eg. huge coding project). All
              partners must contribute equally.
						</li>

						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Dataset:</i></b> <br>
							You must use at least one dataset with at least
							one half million data points as a significant part of
							your project.
						</li>

						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Format:</i></b> <br>
							Your submission must be submitted as a pdf in
							 <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/PaperInformation/AuthorSubmissionInstructions">NIPS format</a>.
							 Note that this means you must use LaTeX with their
							 <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">style file</a>.
							 (NIPS, Neural Information Processing Systems,
							 is one of the major machine learning conferences).<br>
							 If you do not know how to use LaTeX, we reccommend finding a
							 partner who does.
						</li>

						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Code Style:</i></b> <br>
							All code used in the production of your final report should be clean
              <a href="https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/">
								(suggested format)</a>
              and placed into a public GitHub repository under one of
              your partner's accounts. Place a footnote to this
              URL somewhere in your final pdf. This is not required but
              it is recommended to place your code under some
              <a href="http://choosealicense.com/">open-source license</a>
              such as <a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT</a>.
						</li>
					</ul>


					<h3>Due Dates:</h3>

					<ul>
						<br>
						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Week 2 Monday 5:59 pm PST: &nbsp;Project Proposal</i></b><br>
							Typed (LaTeX)
              one page maximum explaining your problem, what data
              sets you are likely to use (you must find some candidates),
              who your partners are, and what methods (of those you know of)
              you think you might use. Note that this is not 100% final
              but it should be within some epsilon of your final project.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Week 9 in class: &nbsp;Midterm Presentation</i></b><br>
							10-12 minute presentation (plus 3 minutes for questions) 
							detailing your progress towards
							your goal. The write-up should be 6 to 8 pages for a 1 person 
							group, 12 to 15 pages for a 2 person group and 15 to 20 for a 3 person group.
						</li>
						<br>

						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Week 12 Monday 5:59 pm PST: &nbsp; Draft of Final Project Submission</i></b> <br>
							Typed (LaTex) draft of final report and all of the codes written
							need to be submitted.
							The draft needs to detail the progress of the final project, which
							is expected to be a significant amount. The draft is
							used to demonstrate what you have done so far and show that you
							are ready for the final presentation.
							It does not need to follow
							the NIPS format (which is required for the final version).
							The code does not
							need to be super clean and organized for this draft submission,
							but it is expected to be cleaned up for final submission. You do
							not need to have the presentation slides ready for this submission.

						</li>
						<br>

						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Week 13 in class: Final Project Presentation</i></b> <br>
							Presentation should as detailed as possible, and it should be
							about 10 minutes to half an hour long.
						</li>
						<br>

						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Week 13 Friday 11:59 pm PST: Final Project Submission</i></b> <br>
							Submission of the final project should be done electronically.
							It must include the Latex final report
							following NIPS format, all codes written for the project, the
							dataset, presentation (.pptx or .pdf) and any other files used.
							Only one copy of each item need be turned in per group.
							Must conform to the requirements above. If the dataset is too
							large to upload it to the Github, please contact instructor or
							TA for submission of the dataset.
