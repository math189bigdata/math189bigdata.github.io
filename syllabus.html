							Kevin Patrick Murphy,
								<a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/">
									<i>Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective</i>
								</a>
							. MIT Press, 2012.

							&#9679; [Up to 5% Extra Credit]
						</p>

						<h3>Course Requirements and Evaluation:</h3>
						<p>
							&#9679; <b><i>Reading Presentations</i></b> <br>

							All readings are compulsory, but some are more compulsory
							than others.<br>

	            To encourage the goal of reading active research in
	            the field, we will assign each non-Murphy reading to a group of
							two students who will write a summary of 1-2 pages 
							to be turned in at the start of class.
							Each student will do approxiamately
							two summaries in total. They must be clear and
							demonstrate that you have read the
	            paper with a high degree of confidence. Credit will be
	            given on a 0-10 scale for each summary. Your summary
							should be done at a high level, and should focus on
	            the main point of the readings (i.e. avoid complicated
	            math). As long as your summary is reasonable, you will
	            be given full credit. <br><br>


							&#9679; <b><i>Homework</i></b> <br>

							The homework is due every week at the beginning of each lecture.
							There will be two parts for each assignment: math and coding.
							The homework is split approximately evenly between
	            mathematical analysis and extension of our course material
	            and application of algorithms to real world data.
							<br><br>
							For coding: You are highly recommended to use Python3. For each problem, the starter code
							and the sample solution are implemented in Python3. All the results and graphs for the sample
							solutions were produced under Python 3.5.2 under macOS Sierra; <b> different versions of
							Python or system environment may produce different results.  You are also welcome to use Jupyter
							Notebooks, but the starter code is not provided in notebook format</b>.
							<br><br>
							<a href="http://www.numpy.org/">Numpy</a> and <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>
							are two important python libraries to know for coding assignment for this
							course. You might also want to look at <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> for
							generating plots.
							If you never used these libraries before, make sure you
							check out the tutorials online before starting the first assignment.
							<br><br>
							<i>Note:</i> <br> 1) When doing the coding problem for each homework set, you are not allowed to use
							any machine learning algorithms implemented by external libraries, such as LinearRegression
							in sklearn. However, you may use these algorithms in your final project.<br><br>
							2) Each homework has both pdf and tex versions. To have the tex files successfully compiled,
							make sure that you have downloaded both <a href="homework/macros.tex">macros.tex</a>
							and <a href="homework/hmcpset.cls">hmcpset.cls</a> and put them
							and the hw tex file under same folder.
							<br> If you have any questions with regard to the compilation of
							the tex files, feel free to ask the grutors for help.<br><br>

							3) For each coding problem, please submit your code to GitHub; please print out any graph or
							printing statements and submit them with the written part.<br><br>


							&#9679; <b><i>Midterm</i></b> <br>

							The midterm will either be a take-home exam covering all 
							topics seen in the first week of the course or a project
							where you will apply the methods learned in the first half
							of the course (TBD).<br><br>

							&#9679; <b><i>Final Project</i></b> <br>

							The final project is the largest component of the course.
							Each student will discover, explore, and attack a real world
							problem of your choosing. The detailed description and requirements
							for the final project can be found under the "Final Project" tab.
							<br><br>

							&#9679; <b><i>GitHub</i></b> <br>

							As we stated in the course overview, students are expected to
							become comfortable with Github. Hence, each student is required
							to create a Github account for coding assignment submission and
							final project submission. If you already have a Github account,
							that's perfect. If not, please create a personal Github account
							and go over the tutorials online.<br>
							<i>Note:</i> Please make sure to send the username of your Github
							account to TA for homework grading.
						</p>


						<h3>Classroom Policies:</h3>
						<p>
							&#9679; <b><i>Attendence</i></b> <br>

							Attendence for each lecture is mandatory and is expected of all
							class members. if you're going to miss a lecture, it is neccessary
							for you to inform the instructor as soon as possible. You are also
							responsible for obtaining notes from another class member.
							<br><br>


							&#9679; <b><i>Devices</i></b> <br>

							You are welcome to use your computer or tablet for note-taking
							(the PowerPoint slides will also be posted shortly after the
							lecture for your convenience).
						</p>

						<h3>Diabilities:</h3>
						<p>
							Students who need disability-related accommodations are
							encouraged to discuss this with the instructor as soon as
							possible.
